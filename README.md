####Introduction

This chunk of code manages the Cart for [PansyPatch.org](https://pansypatch.org). This is a donation system that allows Kappa Alpha Theta sorority members to purchase "Pansies" in honor of their sorority sisters. The system alows the users to search for their sisters and select how many pansies they want to purchase. We utilized Firebase to store all of the donation information after the transaction is made. We're storing user information (not credit card information), donation information, transaction details and updating sorority chapters to credit them with the number of pansies purchased. This information is displayed in real time and visible on the standings page and the dollar amount in the header. The rest of the website is developed with Wordpress to allow the client to easily update imagery and copy for future campaigns.
